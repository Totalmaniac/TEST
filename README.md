# TEST
As discussed earlier today we have a fairly high priority task for our Service Now project and that we need your help with, please see below.

•	Can you run exports of all AD groups in Live01 and Live02
o	Three key columns group name, description, and group category (examples attached however likely out of date)
•	We need a conditional clean up 
o	only interested in descriptions that start with owner and can filter out the rest
o	then need all columns to meet the following exactly
	owner: firstname lastname; deputy: firstname lastname; firstname lastname; firstname lastname 

We actually had a go at this a while back and most already meet fairly close, some extra spaces or – or / that need to be removed to accurately reflect.

Hopefully all makes sense, and off course best to batch script the updates to AD group descriptions with change management process.
